<h1 align="center">UIT-Classworks</h1>

Welcome to the UIT-Classworks repository! This repository serves as a comprehensive collection of all my academic work completed during my Bachelor of Engineering (B.E) degree in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) at UIT. It includes programming assignments, projects, and various academic codes across multiple languages and subjects studied throughout the four years.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized by academic year and further divided into courses and assignments within each year. Here is an overview of the structure:

```
UIT-Classworks/
├── Year1/
│   ├── Course1/
│   │   ├── Assignment1
│   │   ├── prog1
│   │   └── ...
│   ├── Course2/
│   └── ...
├── Year2/
│   ├── Course1/
│   ├── Course2/
│   └── ...
├── Year3/
│   ├── Course1/
│   ├── Course2/
│   └── ...
└── Year4/
    ├── Course1/
    ├── Course2/
    └── ...
```

## Languages and Technologies

The repository includes assignments and projects written in various programming languages and technologies, such as:

- **C/C++**
- **Java**
- **Python**
- **MATLAB**
- **Database Management Systems (DBMS)**
- **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)**
- **Computer Networks**
- **Operating System**

## How to Navigate

1. **Year Folders**: Each year of the degree has its own folder (Year1, Year2, Year3, Year4).
2. **Course Folders**: Within each year, folders are organized by course names or codes (e.g., DBMS, DSA).
3. **Assignment Folders**: Each course folder contains subfolders for individual assignments or projects.

## How to Use

To explore the assignments or projects:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/ImKKingshuk/UIT-Classworks.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the desired directory**:
   ```sh
   cd UIT-Classworks/Year/Course/progx
   ```
3. **Run the code**: Follow the specific instructions provided within each assignment's folder, usually in a `README.md` file or comments within the code.

## Repo Purpose

This repository primarily serves as an archive of my academic work. It is a personal collection of my learning journey and experiences during my B.E degree.
